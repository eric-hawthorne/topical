topical is a mindmap-style note-taking web-application.

A few of topical's features:

1. A distinction between "is a" (subtype-supertype) links between topics and "whole-part" links. 
2. Multiple inheritance. Topics can have multiple supertype topics.
3. Multiple composition. Topics can be part of multiple "whole" topics.
4. Inline editing of topic content in the web browser, using the ckeditor javascript text-editor library.
5. Switch between topic-ontology graph view (mindmap view) and topic-content view.
6. Versioned topics.

topical is written in the relish programming language.
